# A prototype Ruby plugin

This is a sample ground for what a *pure* ruby Jenkins plugin would look like on its own. It is different
than the jenkins-ruby-plugins-playground in that it is not "embedded" inside a vanilla Java plugin.

Instead, the only part that is visible are the ruby parts, and the full Java plugin can be generated by tools.

What tools? Well, the tools we can put in here to do the job. Doing it all by hand the first time, we can flesh out what all moving parts there are and then extract all the tools that can be re-used across the different
plugins.

I think we were putting the cart before the horse a bit, by making the tools first.

# Extensions

Right now, there is a single extension point named [`LogWrapper`](https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-prototype-ruby-plugin/blob/master/models/log_wrapper.rb).
This is just a trivial `BuildWrapper` that outputs a message to the console. However, if we can actually hoist
this guy into the Jenkins runtime, then we're getting somewhere.

# TODO

1. running the plugin in a test server
1. bundling the plugin so that it can be distributed as an .hpi file
